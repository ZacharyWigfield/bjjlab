# bjjlab

An app designed to help users learn brazilian jiu jitsu. MVP features include:

1. A calendar to track your training days. A user can enter a simple input such as: I trained today/tuesday, or a complex input where they can journal their learnings for the day. This will be tracked and visualized with the calendar

2. A simple input will be a basic binary yes/no on a certain day

3. A complex input will include an area for large amounts of text, some selections for techniques that day, and a space available for links to outside resources. 

4. Users should be able to log-in, and the app should authenticate them

5. Users will be able to create a bjj game map. This will be a flowchart of their techniques, and should be shareable so a user can send their coach their map. 



Beyond MVP:

1. Coaches should be able to edit maps and send them back, and the user can save and/or import these edited game maps. 

2. Users should be able to designate a technique of the month, and then in their complex input journal entry, they should be able to check if they were able to work that technique that day. The amount of days the technique of the month was worked will be tracked and reported at the end of the month.
